#### Problem Statement
1. Week 1 - you have to use a DenseNet for Semantic Segmentation on COCO dataset. Structure of DenseNet which has to be used is given in this [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326v3.pdf). You can find the implementation of this paper [here](https://github.com/bfortuner/pytorch_tiramisu). Coco dataset is a very famous dataset used for segmentation purposes. it can be found in kaggle and it is also part of torchvision library. If you are having any storage issues with COCO dataset, you can also use MiniCOCO dataset. [Solution](https://github.com/TRAC-BITS-PILANI/DL_Training/blob/main/week1.ipynb)
